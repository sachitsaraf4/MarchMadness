Since 2011, the NCAA tournament has had 68 teams competing in its field. Eight of those teams compete in the “First Four” — four games that take place before the first round of the tournament. Virtually all bracket pools disregard these games and only have players pick from the first round, when 64 teams remain.

Therefore, there are 63 games in a normal NCAA tournament bracket. 

As such, the number of possible outcomes for a bracket is 2^63, or 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. That’s 9.2 quintillion. 

Thus, if 300 million people are playing, the probability of even one person winning can be 1 in 3 trillion

Thus, the expected payout for Warren Buffet would be (1/3000000000000)*(1000000000) = 0.0003

# Testing

# Prediction function, which will take the year we are predicting for, and the model we will be using to predict

The function will do the following:

- Obtain the match-ups (based on th slot they are playing in) for first round in the particular March Madness year we are predicting for. In the first round, the match up is simple. Each first rank plays from each region with the 16th rank (lowest) from each region, 2nd plays with 15th and so on. We have the data of each seed for each season, so we can obtain the match ups. 

- Obtain the Annual summary stats (Regular season stats) for each team match up

- Calculate the difference between stats for each team match up to get the relative stats (Since our training data is in that format). These will be our testing data points

- Predict the winner for each match

- Store the ids of each winner, and match these teams for the second round based on the slots they won in
- Repeat for each round till round 6 (Finals)
